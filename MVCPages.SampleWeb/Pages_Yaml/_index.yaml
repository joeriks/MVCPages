  # All the following properties are optional 
  # if you omit any of them they will get sensible defaults

  Type: "MVCPages.SampleWeb.Models.PageViewModel"	# defaults to dynamic
  
  
  Url: "/"								# defaults to relative file path - 
  										# with a special case where _index.yaml/json
                                        # translates to the root url of the folder


  Controller: "DefaultPage"				# defaults to built in controller "DefaultPage"
  Action: "Index"						# defaults to built in controller action "Index"
  View: "Index"                         # defaults to null = uses Controller/Action

  # Metadata properties for navigation and more, all optional
  Title: "Metadata title"				
  Description: "Metadata description"
  Order: 2								
  HideInNavigation: false

  # Content is the acual view model data that is sent to the view
  Content:						
    Header: "YAML"
    Introduction: "Intro"
    BodyText: >
        All properties can be a simple string like the ones above.
        Or a multiline text as this. It can contain <a href="/">HTML</a> 
        if you need or even markdown - but then you'll have to take care
        of that in your view or controller. For example you'll need to
        use Html.Raw() in the view to get unescaped Html.
        
        Okay - so this is edited using "Prose" for Github, lets see how that
        works out

###MDHeader
Currently this is not going anywhere, but I guess it could be BodyText by default.
