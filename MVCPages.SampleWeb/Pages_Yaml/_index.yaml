        All properties can be a simple string like the ones above.
        Or a multiline text as this. It can contain <a href="/">HTML</a> 
        if you need or even markdown - but then you'll have to take care
        of that in your view or controller. For example you'll need to
        use Html.Raw() in the view to get unescaped Html.
